# PicPod - Social Media Website

PicPod is a mini social media dashboard developed as part of a coding assignment for the Full-Stack Engineer Intern position. After logging in or signing up, the dashboard interfaces with a mock API to display social media post analytics and allows users to draft and schedule posts. The backend is built using Django, while the frontend utilizes vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Assignment Problem Statement
- Develop a simple dashboard using Django for the backend and choose either React, Vue, or vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend. The dashboard should:

- Interact with a mock API (which you may simulate with static JSON data) to display analytics such as likes, shares, and comments of social media posts.

- Include a feature for user authentication (consider if this is an appropriate challenge for the intern level).

- Allow users to draft and schedule social media posts, assuming a post contains at least a title and description. (Optionally, you may include functionality for images or videos if desired).

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Django
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

## Additional Python Modules Required:
- Django
- Pillow

## Getting Started


**1. Clone the repository to your local machine:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pankaj1251/PicPod.git
